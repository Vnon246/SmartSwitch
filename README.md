Welcome to proyect SmartSwitch by XT LABS!

SmartSwitch borns as a new way to create a smart-button
based on a bunch of different sensors that can read and
detect different conditions and distances.All of this based
on Arduino Platform!

All the code of the proyect its available below for free and licensed 
under a GPL V3 license, that means that you can make part of it by 
helping us debugging code, or even making your own versions! Remember that 
you are an essential part here

We hope you learn something new with us, that is what motivate us to keep working
and making! :).Also you are free to apport new ideas to the proyect, this is a community 
proyect made by makers for makers

Keep making!
