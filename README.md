Proyect SmartSwitch by Vnon246

SmartSwitch proyect borns as a way to make a unique smart-button based
on different sensors that works without the need to touch the button itself.It was
made based on an HC-SR05 sensor plus an LDR resistor to have a better precision
in detecting when you activate it,it is free-software released under GPL V3 license

We hope you learn something new with us that its what motivate us to keep working
and making! :)
