SmartSwitch borns as a new way to create a smart-button
based on a bunch of different sensors that can read and
detect different objects and distances, also it has two
different modes depending of which use is intended for.

It also have a new app based on Blynk CloudÂ© to control
all the differents mode and uses of SmartSwitch and all
